# Bigfoot Becomes Instagram Influencer, Still Nobody Believes He's Real

*1.2M followers, zero credibility*

After decades of blurry photos and failed sightings, Bigfoot has taken matters into his own hands—or paws—by launching an Instagram account. Despite posting daily selfies, unboxing videos, and #OOTD content, everyone assumes it's an elaborate hoax.

## The Origin Story

"I was tired of being called a myth," explains Bigfoot (real name: Daryl, he/him, Pacific Northwest region) while adjusting his ring light. "I'm literally RIGHT HERE. I have a driver's license. I pay taxes—well, I should probably start doing that, actually."

The final straw came when a hiker walked past him in broad daylight, took a photo, posted it with the caption *"Fake Bigfoot costume lol,"* and got 47K likes.

"That was MY ACTUAL BODY," Daryl sighs. "I wasn't even hiding. I was buying trail mix at REI."

> "If people can't find me in the woods, maybe they'll find me on the Explore page."

## The Documentary Pitch

Netflix approached Daryl about a documentary series: *"Becoming Bigfoot: The Daryl Story"*

### Proposed Episodes:

**Episode 1:** "The Making of a Myth" (Daryl: "I'm not MADE. I just AM.")
**Episode 2:** "Behind the Fur" (Daryl: "There's nothing behind it. IT'S MY SKIN.")
**Episode 3:** "The Man Behind the Legend" (Daryl: "I'M NOT A MAN. I'M A CRYPTID.")
**Episode 4:** "Revealing the Truth" (Daryl: "FINALLY.")

The series was canceled when producers discovered Daryl wasn't an actor.

"They thought I was METHOD ACTING," Daryl explains in disbelief. "They kept asking who my agent was. I DON'T HAVE AN AGENT. I HAVE MOSS."

## The Existential Crisis

### Recent Instagram Story Transcript:

*[Daryl, sitting in a forest clearing, looking directly at camera]*

"You know what's wild? I have 1.2 million followers. People comment on every post. They love my 'content.' But not ONE person thinks I'm real."

*[Long pause]*

"I could literally walk into Times Square, wave at a crowd, and they'd be like 'sick costume, bro.'"

*[Another pause]*

"I'm having an identity crisis and I'm not even sure I have an identity to anyone but me."

*[Even longer pause]*

"Also, does anyone know a good therapist who specializes in cryptid-related existential dread? Asking for a friend. The friend is me. I don't have friends. Nobody believes I exist."

## The Future

When asked about his plans, Daryl becomes reflective:

"Maybe I'll start a podcast. 'Definitely Real with Daryl.' We can discuss what it's like to exist in a world that refuses to acknowledge your existence."

*Pause.*

"Or maybe I'll just go back to the woods and let people think I'm a myth. At least then my identity made sense."

*Another pause.*

"Actually, can you help me figure out how to verify my Instagram account? The blue checkmark might help."

---

**Update:** Instagram denied his verification request with the note: *"Account appears to be parody/satire."*

Daryl was last seen rage-posting cryptid memes at 3 AM.
