# Kraken Demands Better WiFi, Threatens to Cancel Cloud Subscription

*Local IT department considers early retirement after mythical creature discovers Zoom*

The North Atlantic Kraken, previously content with simply destroying ships and terrorizing sailors, has discovered the internet. IT departments worldwide are regretting it.

## The Discovery

It started innocently enough. A sinking submarine's satellite internet briefly connected during its descent into the depths. The Kraken, curious about the glowing screens, grabbed a waterproof tablet.

*Three hours later*, the creature had:
- Created 47 social media accounts
- Joined 15 Discord servers
- Started a tech review YouTube channel
- Filed 93 support tickets about underwater connectivity

> "I've been destroying civilization for millennia. But have you TRIED getting a stable 5G signal at 20,000 feet below sea level? THIS is the real nightmare."
>
> <small>— The Kraken, in a strongly-worded email to Verizon</small>

## The Demands List

### Immediate Requirements

**Better WiFi Coverage**
The Kraken's current underwater lair gets approximately 0.3 Mbps. For reference, this is slower than dial-up. The creature is, quote, "absolutely losing it."

**Cloud Storage That Actually Works Underwater**
"It's called the CLOUD," the Kraken wrote in all-caps to multiple tech CEOs. "I am UNDER the clouds. UNDER the water. Why doesn't this work??"

**Video Conferencing Software for Tentacles**
Zoom's interface assumes users have, at most, two hands. The Kraken has eight tentacles and wants to use them all simultaneously. Current setup requires:
- 4 separate Zoom accounts
- 8 different cameras
- One very confused IT administrator
- 47 mute/unmute incidents per meeting

### Reasonable Accommodations Requested

1. **Keyboard designed for tentacles** (current ergonomic options are "laughably inadequate")
2. **Extended mouse warranty** (crush strength of 2000 PSI not covered)
3. **Waterproof everything** (surprisingly, this one is fair)
4. **Tech support that doesn't immediately hang up** upon hearing "Yes, I AM calling from the ocean floor"

## The IT Support Nightmare

Customer support agent Maria Gonzalez has been assigned the Kraken account. She is not doing well.

"Do you know what it's like to explain cookies to a creature that eats ships?" Maria asks, staring at her 47th cup of coffee. "He thinks browser cookies are actual food. He tried to eat his laptop."

### Actual Support Tickets Filed

**Ticket #1: "Computer is wet"**
- Status: Closed (Working as designed for underwater use)
- Kraken's response: "UNACCEPTABLE"

**Ticket #2: "Screen too small to see all my tentacles in video call"**
- Status: Pending (Engineering is confused)
- Suggested solution: "Have you tried using... fewer tentacles?"
- Kraken's response: [Message deleted for profanity]

**Ticket #3: "Why can't I download the ENTIRE internet?"**
- Status: Escalated to Senior Management
- Also Philosophy Department
- Possibly Therapy

## The Streaming Empire

Despite technical difficulties, the Kraken has launched a surprisingly successful tech review channel: **"Kraken Unboxing"**

### Popular Videos

**"I Crushed Every Smartphone to Test Durability"** — 4.2M views
*"The iPhone 15 Pro lasted exactly 0.3 seconds. Disappointing."*

**"WiFi Router Taste Test: Which Brand Tastes Best?"** — 2.8M views
*"TP-Link has a slight oceanic saltiness. Netgear is too crunchy. 3/10 would not eat again."*

**"Why Human Technology is Terrible: A 4-Hour Documentary"** — 847K views
*Comments disabled due to the Kraken getting into arguments with literally every viewer*

## The Corporate Response

Tech companies are scrambling to address their new most-demanding customer.

### Official Statements

**Apple**
"We're excited to announce the iPhone Kraken Edition, featuring 8 simultaneous touch inputs and depth resistance up to 36,000 feet. Pre-orders start never because we haven't figured out shipping yet."

**Microsoft**
"Microsoft Teams now supports tentacle-based reactions. Please stop destroying our underwater data centers."

**Google**
*No comment, but their stock dropped 3% after the Kraken posted a 2-star review of Google Fiber*

## The Email That Broke IT

Last Tuesday, the Kraken sent this to every major tech company:

---

# TO: Every Tech Company
## FROM: The Kraken
### RE: I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED

Dear Silicon Valley,

I have existed for **thousands of years**. I have destroyed **countless ships**. Sailors tell **legends** about my terror.

But NOTHING—and I mean **NOTHING**—has caused me more frustration than:

1. Buffering videos
2. "Password must contain 12 characters, one symbol, and the tears of your enemies"
3. Auto-correct changing "destroy" to "desk toy"
4. **CAPTCHA tests asking me to identify boats**

### DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW OFFENSIVE THAT IS?

I have eaten boats. I AM THE REASON THERE ARE FEWER BOATS.

**FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY.**

Regards,
The Kraken

*P.S. - Your "customer satisfaction survey" was too long. I crushed the laptop. Bill me.*

<small>The email crashed 17 servers. IT departments worldwide reported simultaneous crying.</small>

## The Subscription Situation

The Kraken currently has active subscriptions to:

- **Netflix** (cancelled after one month: "Not enough maritime disasters")
- **Spotify Premium** (kept: "Sea shanties slap")
- **Amazon Prime** (ongoing dispute about underwater delivery)
- **LinkedIn Premium** (active job hunting: "Seeking: Ship Destruction role, 3000+ years experience")
- **Adobe Creative Cloud** ($54.99/month, never used, forgot to cancel like everyone else)

### The Amazon Delivery Problem

> **Kraken:** "Why can't you deliver to coordinates 41°N, 12°W?"
>
> **Amazon:** "Sir, that's 2 miles underwater."
>
> **Kraken:** "I have Prime. It says 2-day delivery ANYWHERE."
>
> **Amazon:** *[Disconnects]*
>
> **Kraken:** *[Destroys a cargo ship in retaliation]*

## The Latest Development

Yesterday, the Kraken discovered **cryptocurrency**.

The entire IT industry is on high alert.

His first tweet from @RealKrakenCrypto: *"If money can be in the CLOUD, why can't it be in the OCEAN? Follow me for investment advice."*

<small>Financial advisors are advising everyone to not follow that advice.</small>

## By The Numbers

Since discovering technology 3 months ago:

- **Reddit karma:** 47,293 (mostly from r/thalassophobia)
- **Instagram followers:** 2.1M (@OceanicDread)
- **Yelp reviews written:** 847 (all 1-star, all about WiFi)
- **Laptops destroyed:** 23
- **IT support agents driven to tears:** 156
- **Successful Zoom calls:** 0

## The Future

When asked about his technology goals, the Kraken was surprisingly thoughtful:

"Look, I just want to participate in modern society. Is that so wrong? I want to attend webinars. I want to complain about Monday mornings. I want to have 47 browser tabs open and wonder why my computer is slow."

*Pause.*

"Also I'm starting a podcast about the decline of maritime safety. Someone teach me how to use a microphone without crushing it."

**The Kraken's Tech Support Hotline:** 1-800-DEEP-SEA
*Please note: Calling this number may result in existential dread and wet phone damage*

<small>*This reporter conducted the interview via heavily encrypted satellite connection. The Kraken still somehow found and crushed our underwater camera. Three stars for enthusiasm.*</small>
