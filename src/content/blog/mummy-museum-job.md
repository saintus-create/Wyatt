# Ancient Mummy Applies for Museum Job, Gets Rejected for Lack of Experience

*"I AM the exhibit. How is that not relevant experience?"*

Amenhotep III (died 1353 BCE, unemployed since 2025) has been rejected from 47 museum positions despite being, quote, "literally ancient Egyptian history." The primary reason? Insufficient work experience.

## The Job Search

After 3,400 years of rest, Amenhotep decided to re-enter the workforce.

"The eternal slumber thing was getting old," he explains, dust falling from his wrappings. "I woke up in a museum storage room and thought, 'I should work here.' Turns out it's harder than ruling Upper and Lower Egypt."

## The Interview Disaster

### Metropolitan Museum of Art - Egyptology Curator Position

**Interviewer:** "Tell me about yourself."

**Amenhotep:** "I am Amenhotep III, Lord of the Two Lands, Builder of Monuments—"

**Interviewer:** "Great! But what's your relevant experience?"

**Amenhotep:** "I *AM* Egyptian history. I *LIVED* it. You have a statue of my wife in Gallery 126."

**Interviewer:** "Yes, but do you have museum management experience?"

**Amenhotep:** "I managed an empire of—"

**Interviewer:** "In the museum sector specifically?"

**Amenhotep:** "I've been an exhibit for 200 years!"

**Interviewer:** "That's not the same as employment. We're looking for someone with at least 5 years of—"

**Amenhotep:** *[Stands up, begins to leave]*

**Interviewer:** "Where are you going?"

**Amenhotep:** "Back to my sarcophagus. This is pointless."

**Status:** Position filled by recent graduate with 6 months internship

Your references from 1300 BCE cannot be verified.

## The Overqualification Problem

### Interview at Small Historical Society

**Interviewer:** "I see you were a pharaoh."

**Amenhotep:** "Yes."

**Interviewer:** "We're looking for someone to answer phones and give tours."

**Amenhotep:** "I can do that."

**Interviewer:** "Honestly? You're overqualified. We can't pay what someone with your background deserves."

**Amenhotep:** "I've been unemployed for 3,400 years. I'll take minimum wage."

### Issue #3: The Gap in Employment

**Every Interview:**

**Interviewer:** "I see a significant gap in your employment history. 1353 BCE to 2025 CE. Can you explain?"

**Amenhotep:** "I was dead."

**Interviewer:** "And what were you doing during that time?"

**Amenhotep:** "...Being dead. And occasionally being studied by archaeologists."

**Interviewer:** "So no professional development?"

**Amenhotep:** "I MAINTAINED MY PHYSICAL FORM FOR 34 CENTURIES. That's dedication."

## The Gig Economy Attempt

Desperate for income, Amenhotep tried freelancing:

### Task Rabbit - "Historical Consultation"

**Rating:** ⭐ (1.2 stars)

**Reviews:**

**Jennifer M.:** *"Hired him to help with my kid's Egypt project. He spent 2 hours complaining about historical inaccuracies in The Mummy (1999). One star."*

**Mark T.:** *"Asked for help moving furniture. He refused, saying 'I am divine royalty, not a laborer.' Then he complained that I don't have servants. Zero stars."*

**Sarah K.:** *"Wanted authentic hieroglyphics translated. He translated them and then lectured me about improper veneration of the gods for 45 minutes. Never again."*

### Uber Driver

**Application Status:** Rejected

**Reason:** "Mummy-wrapped hands cannot safely operate steering wheel"

**Amenhotep's Appeal:** "I commanded 100,000 charioteers!"

**Uber's Response:** "Sir, this is different."

### Cameo

**Status:** Active (finally accepted somewhere)

**Price:** $500 per video

**Bookings:** 2

**Reviews:**

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"Hired him for my egyptology professor's birthday. He was great! Although he did curse the professor's research as 'woefully incomplete.' Professor loved it."*

⭐⭐ *"Paid for a fun birthday message. Got a 10-minute rant about how Netflix's Cleopatra documentary was wrong about everything. Accurate, but not what I asked for."*

## The Unpaid Internship Offer

After 47 rejections, Amenhotep finally got an offer: unpaid internship at a small museum.

**Position:** Gallery Assistant Intern
**Pay:** $0
**Benefits:** "Great learning opportunity!"
**Requirements:** Bachelor's degree, 2 years experience

**Amenhotep's Response:**

```
Dear Hiring Manager,

I appreciate the offer but must decline.

I ruled an empire.
I built monuments that survived millennia.
I'm literally in your competitor's collection.

I will not work for free.

Regards,
Amenhotep III
Former Pharaoh, Current Job Seeker
```

## The Breakthrough

Finally, one museum saw potential:

**Natural History Museum - "Living History Interpreter"**

**Job Description:** Dress in historical costume, educate visitors about ancient Egypt

**Amenhotep:** "I don't need a costume. I AM ancient Egypt."

**Interviewer:** "That's... actually perfect. You're hired."

**Pay:** $18/hour

**Amenhotep's Thought:** *"I once owned all the gold in Egypt. Now I make $18/hour."*

## First Day on the Job

### 9:00 AM - Orientation

**HR:** "Welcome! Let's go over benefits. We offer health insurance—"

**Amenhotep:** "I'm already dead. What would I claim?"

**HR:** "...Dental?"

**Amenhotep:** *[Opens mouth revealing 3400-year-old teeth]*

**HR:** "Moving on."

### 11:00 AM - First Tour

**Amenhotep:** "Welcome! I am Amenhotep III, and I will be your guide to ancient Egypt."

**Tourist:** "Cool costume! You really commit to the role!"

**Amenhotep:** "This is not a costume. These are my ACTUAL burial wrappings."

**Tourist:** "Wow, method acting! Love it!"

**Amenhotep:** *[Sighs in ancient Egyptian]*

### 2:00 PM - Incident Report

**Manager:** "Amenhotep, we received a complaint."

**Amenhotep:** "About what?"

**Manager:** "You told a child that King Tut was 'a minor pharaoh who got too much attention.'"

**Amenhotep:** "That's historically accurate."

**Manager:** "The kid was wearing a King Tut t-shirt."

**Amenhotep:** "Then the child should know the truth."

**Manager:** "Please... just stick to the script."

## The Job Review

After 3 months:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Authentic knowledge
- ✅ Never calls in sick
- ✅ Draws huge crowds

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ Stop correcting the exhibit placards
- ❌ Don't refer to visitors as "mortals"
- ❌ Stop ranking pharaohs during tours
- ❌ Cannot claim exhibits as "personal property"

**Overall:** 3.5/5 - "Satisfactory performance with room for modern adaptation"

---

**Amenhotep is currently employed** at the Natural History Museum, where he gives tours, complains about historical inaccuracies, and dreams of the days when people properly feared pharaohs.

**Still Open to New Opportunities:** Senior roles only. No internships.

<small>*This reporter interviewed Amenhotep during his lunch break. He doesn't eat lunch. He spent the time critiquing the museum's cafeteria mural for historical inaccuracies. Four stars for dedication to accuracy.*</small>
