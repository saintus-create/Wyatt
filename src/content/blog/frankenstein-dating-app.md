# Frankenstein's Monster Joins Dating App, Profile Says 'No Drama'

*Swipe right for existential conversations and potentially being chased by villagers*

Adam Frankenstein (created 1818, single since forever) has reluctantly joined Tinder after 200 years of isolation. His experience so far: "Modern dating is somehow worse than being assembled from corpse parts."

## The Profile

**ADAM, 207**
*6'8" | Science Experiment | Looking for something real*

**Photos:**
1. Moody mirror selfie (bathroom, stitches visible)
2. Hiking in the Alps (running from angry mob)
3. Reading poetry (Byron, obviously)
4. With dog (it ran away immediately after photo)

**Bio:**
```
Looking for someone who accepts me for who I am:
an 8-foot tall reanimated corpse with abandonment issues.

I enjoy:
✨ Long walks (fleeing from pitchfork-wielding villagers)
✨ Deep conversations (about existence and stuff)
✨ Reading (Romantic poetry hits different when you're literally a Romantic-era creation)
✨ Solitude (not by choice)

Deal breakers:
❌ Scientists who "just want to see what makes me tick"
❌ People who make Frankenstein jokes (I'm not Frankenstein, he's the doctor)
❌ Torch enthusiasts
❌ Anyone who says "it's a Frankenstein thing"

Looking for: Someone kind. That's it. Please.
Just one kind person.

No hookups. Literally looking for genuine connection.
Not interested in drama.
```

---

### Date #2: The Honest One

**Match:** David, 30, History teacher

This one actually went well. They talked about Romantic literature, societal rejection, and the human condition.

**Adam:** "You're not bothered by my appearance?"

**David:** "Honestly? You're different. But you're thoughtful, well-read, and you haven't checked your phone once."

**Adam:** "I don't have a phone plan. No credit history."

**David:** "That's... actually a problem. How do we stay in touch?"

**Adam:** "Carrier pigeon?"

**David:** "I think you're joking but I genuinely can't tell."

**Status:** Went on 3 dates, then David moved to Boston for work

**Adam's note:** *"Finally met someone kind and they moved 200 miles away. Classic."*

## The Profile Updates

After 50 matches and 0 successful connections, Adam revised his profile:

### Version 2.0:

**Bio:**
```
Full disclosure: I'm 8 feet tall, assembled from corpses, and glow green under UV light.

Yes, I have trauma.
Yes, I'm working on it.
No, I won't "just get over" being abandoned by my creator.

Looking for someone who:
✅ Reads books
✅ Likes long conversations
✅ Won't immediately flee when meeting in person
✅ Accepts that I'm literally a monster

I'm kind, thoughtful, and will never ghost you
(ironic for someone who associates with ghosts).

Not here for games. Already played God once. Didn't work out.
```

**Matches:** Dropped to zero

### Version 3.0: The Desperate Phase

**Bio:**
```
208 years old but young at heart! (Technically someone else's heart but whatever)

Love nature walks and reading.
Good listener.
Very loyal (nowhere else to go).

Please just give me a chance.
I'm so alone.
```

**Matches:** 3 (all scammers)

### Version 4.0: The Acceptance

**Bio:**
```
Look, I'm a reanimated corpse. If that's not an immediate no, we should talk.

I like poetry, thunderstorms, and long discussions about what it means to be human when you're technically not human.

Not looking for perfection. Just someone who won't light torches and chase me.

Low bar, I know.
```

**Matches:** 12 (mostly goth girls and biology students)

## The Success Story (Sort Of)

After 6 months, Adam matched with Luna, a mortician.

**Luna:** "Your bio is refreshingly honest."

**Adam:** "Thank you. Most people think it's off-putting."

**Luna:** "I work with dead bodies. You're technically advanced corpse science."

**Adam:** "That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me."

**Luna:** "That's sad."

**Adam:** "I know."

**Status:** Currently dating
**Luna's Review:** "He's sweet, well-read, and great at reaching high shelves. The villagers are annoying though."

## The Advice Column

After finding moderate success, Adam now advises other monsters:

### "Dear Adam" Column:

**Q: "I'm a vampire and keep scaring dates when I hiss at garlic bread. Help?"**

**A:** *"Stop going to Italian restaurants. Also, own it. If they can't accept your dietary restrictions, they're not worth it."*

**Q: "The Invisible Man here. How do I take good profile photos?"**

**A:** *"That's... actually a great question. Try holding things? Wear a hat? I don't know, man. Good luck."*

**Q: "Swamp Thing. Everyone says I smell like marsh water."**

**A:** *"You DO smell like marsh water. Embrace it. Find someone who likes 'natural' scents. Maybe a botanist?"*

## The Conclusion

After one year on dating apps:

**Matches:** 247
**Dates:** 18
**Second Dates:** 4
**Relationships:** 1 (current)
**Therapy Sessions Required:** 26
**Villagers Evaded:** 12
**Times Reported as Catfish:** 33

**Lesson Learned:** *"Modern dating is horrible for everyone. At least I'm not alone in being alone."*

**Adam's Dating Profile** is still active (as backup, he says).
**Current Status:** "In a relationship" (with caveats)
**Location:** Undisclosed (for safety from both dates AND villagers)

<small>*This reporter matched with Adam for research purposes. The date was lovely. He quoted Shelley's poetry and paid for dinner. Five stars, would recommend if you can get past the stitches.*</small>
