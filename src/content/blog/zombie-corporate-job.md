# Zombie Gets Promoted to Middle Management, Nobody Notices the Difference

*"I fit right in," he groans, gesturing vaguely at spreadsheet*

Derek Thompson (deceased 2023, employed 2024) has been promoted to Senior Project Manager at TechCorp Solutions. His colleagues describe him as "dedicated," "always hungry for results," and "a little slow on emails."

None of them realize he's been dead for two years.

## The Resurrection

Derek died in a freak office accident involving a malfunctioning coffee machine and a server room. Three weeks later, he shambled back to work.

"I thought it was just a really bad hangover," explains his manager, Patricia. "Derek showed up Monday morning, groaning, moving slowly, staring vacantly at his screen. Standard Monday behavior."

> "Braaaaains... I mean, quarterly reports. Need quarterly reports."

The promotion came six months later. Derek's performance review cited:
- **Consistent attendance** (he literally can't leave)
- **Strong work ethic** (driven by insatiable hunger)
- **Team player** (mostly harmless)
- **Great at staying late** (no longer requires sleep)

## The Daily Routine

### 9:00 AM - Morning Standup

**Team Lead:** "Derek, what did you work on yesterday?"

**Derek:** "Grrraaahhh... *[shuffles papers]* ...status reports..."

**Team Lead:** "Great! Any blockers?"

**Derek:** "Huuuunger... I mean, hunger for success. No blockers."

**Team:** *[Nods approvingly]*

### 12:30 PM - Lunch Meeting

Derek orders a rare steak. Very rare. Still moving.

"He's keto," whispers Sandra from Accounting. "Respect the diet."

Derek gnaws on the steak, occasionally moaning. Everyone assumes it's about the upcoming deadline.

### 3:00 PM - Performance Review

**HR:** "Derek, your productivity has been... consistent."

**Derek:** "Braaains... strategies. Need strategies."

**HR:** "Exactly! We love your focus on strategic thinking. You're getting a raise."

**Derek:** *[Tries to eat the performance review document]*

**HR:** "We'll email you a copy."

```

## The Management Philosophy

When asked about his leadership style, Derek provides surprisingly coherent answers (between groans):

"Lead by example... *[groan]* ...set clear expectations... *[shuffles]* ...eat the weak—I MEAN, support the team..."

### His Management Principles:

1. **Always be hungry** (for results)
2. **Move slowly but deliberately** (strategic patience)
3. **Consume all obstacles** (aggressive problem-solving)
4. **Never stop moving forward** (persistence)
5. **Embrace decay** (accepting impermanence of projects)

## The Performance Metrics

### Derek's Quarterly Results:

**Projects Completed:** 7
**Projects Consumed (literally):** 2
**Team Morale:** Surprisingly high
**Team Members Bitten:** 3 (all minor incidents)
**HR Complaints:** 47
**HR Complaints Resolved:** 0 (Derek ate them)

**Overall Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"Exceeds Expectations"*

## The Office Politics

Derek has inadvertently become excellent at corporate politics:

### Political Maneuver #1: The Awkward Silence
**Normal Response:** Attempt to fill silence with words
**Derek's Approach:** Stands silently, staring
**Result:** Everyone assumes deep thought, treats him as wise

### Political Maneuver #2: The Difficult Conversation
**Normal Response:** Carefully chosen diplomatic language
**Derek's Approach:** "Graaahhh..."
**Result:** Universally interpreted as agreeing with whoever's talking

### Political Maneuver #3: The Power Play
**Normal Response:** Strategic positioning, networking
**Derek's Approach:** Shambles into executive meetings uninvited
**Result:** Mistaken for confidence, gets invited to more meetings

## The Training Session Disaster

Derek was asked to lead a workshop on "Agile Methodologies."

### Workshop Highlights:

**9:00 AM** - Derek shambles to podium
**9:05 AM** - Writes "BRAINS" on whiteboard
**9:10 AM** - Team assumes it's an acronym
**9:15 AM** - Entire department brainstorming what BRAINS stands for
**9:45 AM** - Someone suggests "Building Responsive, Agile, Innovative, Networked Systems"
**9:46 AM** - Derek groans approvingly (he was actually just hungry)
**10:00 AM** - Workshop rated 4.7/5 stars

**Feedback:** *"Derek's unconventional teaching style really made us think outside the box!"*

## The Corporate Jargon Advantage

Zombie-speak perfectly aligns with corporate communication:

### Translation Guide:

| Derek Says | Team Hears |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Graaaahh..." | "Let's circle back on that" |
| "Braaains..." | "Let's leverage our core competencies" |
| *[Stares blankly]* | "I'm actively listening" |
| *[Shuffles papers]* | "Reviewing the data" |
| *[Tries to bite intern]* | "Aggressive mentorship style" |

## The Team Building Retreat

Derek attended the annual team building retreat. It went surprisingly well.

### Trust Fall Exercise:
- Derek fell
- Didn't get back up for 20 minutes
- Team assumed it was a meditation exercise
- Everyone rated it "transformative"

### Escape Room Challenge:
- Derek broke down the door
- Team escaped in record time
- Facility requested he never return
- Team won "Most Creative Problem Solving" award

### Bonding Dinner:
- Derek ordered raw chicken
- Groaned throughout meal
- Everyone assumed he was being health-conscious
- Inspired three coworkers to try paleo diet

## The Annual Review

**CEO:** "Derek, you've been an asset to this company."

**Derek:** "Huuuunger... growth... success..."

**CEO:** "Exactly! Hungry for growth and success! That's the spirit we need."

**Derek:** *[Lunges toward CEO]*

**CEO:** "Wow, eager to shake hands! I love the enthusiasm!"

**Derek:** *[Settles for handshake instead of consuming CEO]*

**CEO:** "15% raise, effective immediately."

## The Revelation That Never Comes

Last week, Derek's skin turned notably gray during a Zoom call.

**Colleague's reaction:** "Wow, Derek, you need more vitamin D! Maybe take a vacation?"

**Derek:** "Graaahhh..."

**Colleague:** "I know, PTO requests are such a pain. HR, am I right?"

## The Future

When asked about his five-year plan, Derek provided this response:

"Consume... I mean, ASSUME more responsibility... *[groan]* ...strategic growth... *[shuffles]* ...becoming regional manager... *[tries to eat interviewer's notepad]*"

HR has already approved his promotion track.

### Upcoming Initiatives:
- Leading the Q4 strategy session
- Mentoring junior employees (from a safe distance)
- Attending leadership training (they've agreed to provide raw meat snacks)
- Possibly eating the competition (literal or figurative, TBD)

## The Lesson

In an industry famous for corporate zombies, Derek has proven that the difference between actual zombies and middle management is mostly cosmetic.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Groaning** is indistinguishable from corporate jargon
2. **Slow movement** reads as "strategic thinking"
3. **Vacant stares** signal "deep focus"
4. **Consuming everything** is just "aggressive growth mindset"
5. **Being dead inside** is a prerequisite, not a dealbreaker
